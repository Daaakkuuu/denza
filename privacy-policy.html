  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

  <p>
   Fakhro Motors ( DENZA BAHRAIN) collects information from our users at several different points on our Web site. Fakhro Motors (DENZA BAHRAIN) is the sole owner of the information collected on this site. Fakhro Motors (DENZA BAHRAIN) uses two types of user information: anonymous information gathered from cookies and log files, and personal information you provide us for certain services.
  </p>

  <h2>Our Privacy Statement</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>We respect your privacy and your choices.</li>
    <li>We make sure that privacy and security are embedded in everything we do.</li>
    <li>We do not send you marketing communications unless you have asked us to. You can change your mind at any time.</li>
    <li>We never offer or sell your data.</li>
    <li>We are committed to keeping your data safe and secure. This includes only working with trusted partners.</li>
    <li>We are committed to being open and transparent about how we use your data.</li>
       <li>We do not use your data in ways that we have not told you about.</li>
        <li>We respect your rights, and always try to accommodate your requests as far as is possible, in line with our own legal and operational responsibilities.</li>
  </ul>
<h2 >ANONYMOUS INFORMATION - COOKIES AND LOG FILES</h2>
   <p>A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user’s hard drive containing information about the user. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to personal information, until a user provides that information (see below). If a user rejects or deletes the cookie, he/she may still use our site. The only drawback to this is that the user will be limited in some areas of our site. For example, the user will not be able to receive notification of special offers, or participate in any contests that may take place. Cookies also enable us to track and aggregate click stream behaviour data. By doing this we can better target the interests of our users and enhance their experience on our site.</p>

   <p >BYD also maintains standard web logs that record data about all visitors to this Web site. These logs may contain</p>
      <p >The Internet domain from which you access this site.</p>
      <p >Your IP address (Your computer is automatically assigned an IP address when you surf the Internet. Your IP address is either static or dynamic. A static IP address may be identifiable to you; a dynamic address is usually not identifiable to you).</p>
      <p >The type of browser and operating system you use.</p>
      <p >The date and time you visited this site.</p>
      <p >The pages you viewed on this site.</p>
      <p >The address of the Web site from which you linked.</p>

       <p >BYD uses web log and click stream information to help us design our site, to identify popular site features and to make the site more useful for visitors. Web logs are recorded in sequential files, and we normally do not attempt to identify individuals from these logs. However, we may use web logs to identify persons attempting to break into, disrupt, or damage our Site. We may share web log information with law enforcement personnel if we believe evidence exists, or is likely to occur, of a violation of federal, state or local laws or regulations.</p>
      <p >BYD advertising at other non-BYD sites may be serviced by BYD service providers, who may use cookies to collect information about your visits to those sites. Information collected may include the pages visited, date and time, browser information and/or IP address. We normally make no attempt to link this information to you personally, except under circumstances described above. This information is gathered in order to help us customize and target our advertising to the needs and interests of our customers. If you wish to opt out of this tracking at our advertising at third party sites, please visit the site of our service provider. Should you decide that you do not wish to participate in our service provider -enabled information delivery, you can opt out from there, or by clicking here.</p>
      <h2>PERSONAL INFORMATION</h2>
       <p >Users may choose to volunteer personal information (name, e-mail address, phone number, etc.) in order for us to provide them with services such as brochure and information requests, surveys and contests, site announcements, and special offers at the time of the request or in the future. If you previously gave us your e-mail address and no longer wish to receive e-mail announcements, you can have your name removed from our e-mail list by sending an e-mail to <span ><a href="mailto:emobility@fakhro.com">emobility@fakhro.com</a></span> , calling, or by sending regular mail (see contact information below).</p>
      <p >Fakhro Motors does not sell or rent user information to any third parties. We share user information with our affiliates and dealers, and marketing partners contracted to do business on our behalf (e.g., brochure fulfilment). When the user signs up for certain services and offers on our site, we will share names, or other contact information necessary for any associate third party to provide these services. Fakhro Motors will share user information in accordance with the privacy policy in effect at the time the information is collected</p>
      <p >If a user’s personal information changes, we will endeavour to provide a way to correct or update that user’s personal data provided to us. This can be done by e-mailing <span ><a href="mailto:emobility@fakhro.com">emobility@fakhro.com</a></span>  or by contacting Fakhro Motors Consumer Affairs as outlined below.</p>
      <p >How we collect your personal data?</p>
      <p >Personal data is collected at different times and from different sources including but not limited to:</p>
      <p >When you or your organisation contact us to consider engaging our services;</p>
      <p >Information gathered through our client due diligence procedures as part of our compliance requirements with regulatory authorities;</p>
      <p >Through email, fax or telephone communication;</p>
      <p >From third parties; and</p>
      <ul>
        <li>When you or your organisation provides services to us or offer to do so.</li>
      </ul>
      <p >Retention of personal information and security</p>
      <p >Your personal information will be retained for as long as required:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>For the purpose for which the personal information was collected;</li>
        <li>In order to satisfy any reporting or accounting obligations; and</li>
        <li>As required by data protection laws and any other applicable laws or regulatory requirements.</li>
      </ul>
      <p >Access to your personal data</p>
      <p >If you have submitted information to Fakhro Motors, you have the following rights:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>To access that data and port (transfer) such personal information;</li>
        <li>To rectify personal information where the information we hold about you is incorrect;</li>
        <li>To restrict the use of personal information;</li>
        <li>To request that personal information is erased;</li>
        <li>To object to processing of personal information; and</li>
        <li>Submit a complaint if you have concerns about the way in which we are handling your data to <span ><a href="mailto:emobility@fakhro.com">emobility@fakhro.com</a></span></li>
      </ul>
       <h2 >SECURITY</h2>
      <p >Fakhro Motors takes all reasonable precautions to protect our users’ information, both while the information is being transmitted and after it is received by us.</p>
      <p >When our credit pre-approval form asks users to enter sensitive information (such as social security number), that information is encrypted and is protected with SSL 128-bit encryption software, an industry standard for reputable organizations. While on a secure page, such as our credit pre-approval application form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to unlocked, or open, when you are just "surfing."</p>
      <p >Furthermore, once the information has been received by us, we use security procedures and policies commensurate with industry standards to safeguard against loss, theft, unauthorized access, destruction, use, modification and disclosure. If you have any questions about the security of our Web site, you can send an e-mail to <span ><a href="mailto:emobility@fakhro.com">emobility@fakhro.com</a></span></p>
      <h2 >NOTIFICATION OF CHANGES</h2>
      <p >We retain the right to change this privacy policy at any time. We will display those changes to this page so that users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances we disclose it. We will use, share, and disclose all information in accordance with the privacy policy in effect at the time the information was collected.</p>
      <h2 >DISCLOSURES</h2>
      <p >Fakhro Motors may disclose any data, whether personally identifiable or not, to any person performing audit, legal, operational or other similar services for Fakhro Motors. Whenever possible, we will require any recipient of personal information for these purposes to agree in writing to hold the information in confidence, to use the information only for the permitted purpose, and to return or destroy the information when the services are completed.</p>
      <p >We may also disclose any data, whether personally identifiable or not, when required to do so by subpoena, court order, or warrant. Whenever feasible, Fakhro Motors will notify the effected user by e-mail that such disclosure will or has occurred.</p>
      <h2 >Privacy Policy</h2>
      <p >We may also disclose any data, whether personally identifiable or not, when we reasonably deem it necessary to protect the safety of (i) an individual, (ii) the public, or (iii) the security and reliability of Fakhro Motors and/or this Web site.</p>
